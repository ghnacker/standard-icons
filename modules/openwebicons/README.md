## Install

npm install --save @icon/openwebicons
```

## Usage

There are many ways/formats of how to use openwebicons. The fastest and recommended way is via SVG directly. Or use the webfont version if you want to include all icons at once:

### SVG icons – when you need just a few icons in your project

  1. If you want to use just a few icons. Find the icons you need in "icons" folder. Then use them as regular images:

```
  <img height="32" width="32" src="@icon/openwebicons/icons/apml.svg" />
```

  2. Icons can be served from a CDN such as [Unpkg][Unpkg]. Simply use the `@icon/openwebicons` npm package in the URL like the following:

```
  <img height="32" width="32" src="https://unpkg.com/@icon/openwebicons/icons/apml.svg" />
```

### Icons font – ideal when you want to include all icons at once

  1. Install `@icon/openwebicons` with this command. In the `<head>` of your html, reference the location to your `openwebicons.css`.

```
  <head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="@icon/openwebicons/openwebicons.css">
  ...
  </head>
```

  2. Use [unpkg.com][Unpkg] to load directly openwebicons without installing anything:

```
  <head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@icon/openwebicons/openwebicons.css">
  ...
  </head>
```

> Place openwebicons with `<i>` tag in your html like this. Icon class names are to be used with the `owi` class prefix.

```
  <i class="owi owi-apml"></i>
```
