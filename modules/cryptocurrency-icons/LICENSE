# Cryptocurrency Icons

[This project](http://cryptoicons.co) contains over 6000 icons ‚Äì almost 400 crypto currencies, in 4 styles and a range of sizes. Completely free. All we ask is that you don‚Äôt claim them as your own, and share this resource with others.

We also have some fiat currencies: `USD`, `GBP`, `EUR`, `JPY`, `CNY`, `RUB`. *(We don't intend to add more)*

Images are in the PNG format (transparent) in `32√ó32`, `32√ó32 (2x)`, and `128√ó128` variants, along with SVG versions.

If there is an altcoin you‚Äôre looking for that hasn‚Äôt been included, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/atomiclabs/cryptocurrency-icons/issues/new).


## Install üöÄ

```
$ npm install cryptocurrency-icons
```

You can then import the icons from `./node_modules/cryptocurrency-icons`, for example `./node_modules/cryptocurrency-icons/svg/color/kmd.svg`.
